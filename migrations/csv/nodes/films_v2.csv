429200,Good Time,Good Time,2017,Safdie Brothers,en,102,"Fluorescent hues illuminate the nighttime action, framed up and made glowing by indie cinematographer Sean Price Williams on his second collaboration with the duo, and their first shooting on 35mm. Josh and Benny Safdie’s entry in the genre of cops and robbers is a heist film with heart, the beating centre of which is frantically propelled by the electronic score of Oneohtrix Point Never. When rare moments of reprieve come, they’re sustained and softened by the bonds of brotherly love.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/5IDBK15B5fGVxwZQrzebi5Udsd4.jpg
49964,Where Is The Friend's House?,خانه‌ی دوست کجاست؟,1987,Abbas Kiarostami,ar,83,"The first film in Abbas Kiarostami’s sublime, interlacing KOKER TRILOGY takes a simple premise—a boy searches for the home of his classmate, whose school notebook he has accidentally taken—and transforms it into a miraculous, child’s-eye adventure of the everyday. As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility. Sensitive and profound, WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is shot through with all the beauty, tension, and wonder a single day can contain.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/qbE0I3IhrDCGwG4oKT4QcFsIa1L.jpg
531428,Portrait of a Lady on Fire,Portrait de la jeune fille en feu,2019,Céline Sciamma,fr,121,"Passion brews quietly between an artist and her subject, until together they create a space in which it can briefly flourish, in this sumptuous eighteenth-century romance from Céline Sciamma, one of contemporary French cinema’s most acclaimed auteurs. Summoned to an isolated seaside estate on a secret assignment, Marianne (Noémie Merlant) must find a way to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who is resisting chattel marriage, by furtively observing her. What unfolds in exquisite tension is an exchange of sustained gazes in which the two women come to know each other’s gestures, expressions, and bodies with rapturous intimacy, ultimately forging a subversive creative collaboration as well as a delirious romance.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/foFq1RZWQIgFuCQ0nyYccywjFyX.jpg
780,The Passion of Joan of Arc,La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc,1928,Carl Theodor Dreyer,fr,82,"Spiritual rapture and institutional hypocrisy come to stark, vivid life in one of the most transcendent masterpieces of the silent era. Chronicling the trial of Joan of Arc in the hours leading up to her execution, Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer depicts her torment with startling immediacy, employing an array of techniques—expressionistic lighting, interconnected sets, painfully intimate close-ups—to immerse viewers in her subjective experience.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/p5ImOyTw6MMjaOWx0vcnBuZU7vQ.jpg
499556,An Elephant Sitting Still,大象席地而坐,2018,Hu Bo,zh,234,"The titular animal in Hu Bo’s An Elephant Sitting Still is a fabled creature in inner Mongolia’s Manzhouli, the odd object of preoccupation for the film’s four dissipated characters that is at once ancient and stoic; an inanimate, timeworn witness to human atrocities and a symbol of resistance against a hostile world of smugness and decadence—in short, an apt metaphor for the pursuit of such a pure cinema. But in the time following the film’s tormented production as its writer-director-editor took his own life at 29 years old, An Elephant Sitting Still and its emblem also became inevitably imbued with a sense of individual tragedy and isolation, becoming an arresting epitaph to a fierce artistic spirit and sadly truncated personal history.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/tFCaVKM43XvcVPmzhJVoDSkhXLW.jpg
3082,Modern Times,Modern Times,1936,Charlie Chaplin,en,87,"Charlie Chaplin’s final silent-esque comedy is a satire of working life—with a smile, or something like it. The assembly line is where we meet Chaplin’s alter ego, the Tramp, and if his bosses at the Electro Steel Corp. had their way, the assembly line is a place he’d never leave! Chaplin’s ramped-up slapstick skits show all of management’s methods of control, including mechanized lunch breaks and muscle-memory-demanding workloads. Bolts and wrenches aren’t what the ​“modern” world is made out of anymore, but Chaplin’s characters are motivated by familiar fears: hunger and unemployment.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/y8Wg2X8rQGb5Lsu1dL89FqSR2tf.jpg
53925,The Mouth of the Wolf,La bocca del lupo,2009,Pietro Marcello,it,71,"Commissioned by a Jesuit order, this moving, melancholic portrait of an unlikely love story — between a macho, mustachioed Sicilian hoodlum and a transsexual former heroin addict — is also a meditation on the port city of Genoa, whose past glory and present decline provides the ghostly backdrop to the central, Pasolinian narrative. Tinged with the tenebrous tones of the city’s nocturnal underbelly, featuring excerpts from Gaspare Invrea’s eponymous 1892 book and music from Buxtende, The Mouth of the Wolf reaches deep into the recesses of memory to create a hybrid documentary about dreams and decay.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/3LkdeGYYL2sE666XvIfftHQAAip.jpg
576404,And Your Bird Can Sing,きみの鳥はうたえる,2018,Sho Miyake,ja,106,"A love triangle that captures all the magic and melancholy of a summer, concentrating on the fleeting moments and encounters experienced by its three protagonists.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/nwkRa7v9fDw60cS45Ehww74CNBy.jpg
11534,Tropical Malady,สัตว์ประหลาด,2004,Apichatpong Weerasethakul,th,114,"The story of Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Tropical Malady (2004) seems simple enough at the outset: a handsome soldier stationed in a rural community on the edge of the forest in northern Thailand meets a young village man. Their lives are by and large carefree, filled with an innocence that feels entirely fitting with the peace and splendor of the countryside around them—the tawny deciduous jungle punctuated with lakes and rolling grassland, the mountains that stretch to Laos and Myanmar in the distance. They listen to pop music, stroll around the night market in the small local town, visit cave temples, spend quiet afternoons sheltering from rainstorms in a sala overlooking a tranquil pond. They fall in love.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/ffMpzS1hUs7tVNyJf7dYfxACyTk.jpg
44012,"Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles","Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles",1976,Chantal Akerman,fr,202,"A singular work in film history, Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles meticulously details, with a sense of impending doom, the daily routine of a middle-aged widow, whose chores include making the beds, cooking dinner for her son, and turning the occasional trick. In its enormous spareness, Akerman’s film seems simple, but it encompasses an entire world.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/z81DzVg9lrBPr4M88ldmZ3FbBUY.jpg
